# NHL-Postseason-Predictor
This Machine Learning based Python script aims to predict the winner of a 7 game NHL series based on the game/team data compiled and a Support Vector Machine algorithm using the SciKit Learn, Pandas, and NumPy libraries. Team data was compiled over the course of the 2021 NHL season. 

A SVM model is used to categorize team performances into a typical "Win" or "Loss", such that when two teams meet in the playoffs, the result of the series can be decided based on if the opponents' stats fell into the "Win" or "Loss" category. This is the preliminary model, which had slim success according to the real data.
